Dining Philosophers Problem Simulation with Threads and Mutexes

This project is a simulation of the famous Dining Philosophers Problem, implemented using threads as philosophers and mutexes as forks. The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science that illustrates the challenges of resource allocation and deadlock avoidance in concurrent systems.

The simulation provides a visual representation of the problem, where philosophers (represented as threads) sit around a circular table, and forks (represented as mutexes) are placed between each pair of philosophers. The objective is to allow the philosophers to share the forks (resources) in a way that avoids deadlocks and ensures fairness.
